# Agent instructions

Follow `README.md` conventions for structure, scope, and minimalism.

## Paths
- API code: `bush/back`
- Web code: `bush/view`
- Ideas: `bush/idea`
- Plans: `bush/plan`

## Style
- Use as few files and dependencies as possible.
- Keep comments and docs minimal.
- Avoid async implementations unless requirements change.
